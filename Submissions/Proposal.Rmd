## Project Topic
Monte Carlo Simulation of a Hypothesis Test of Binomially Distributed Samples [One-sample z-test for a binomial proportion]

## Simulation vs. Dataset
We will using pure simulation

## Project Detial

## User Input (Shiny Components)

Users will be able to modify the following:

1. 
2.
3. 
4. **Significance level ($\alpha$):** slider with range 0 to 1 
     - Users can set the threshold for statistical significance. This will dynamically update the rejection region on the plot and recalculate the estimated Type I error rate.
5. **Colour scheme:** dropdown box with a few options
  - Users can select from a few colour scheme options (including colour schemes that are colour-blind friendly [@nichols2026]) and change the colour of the plot features (e.g. bars or lines).
6. **Toggle between different graphs:** a button to switch between different graphs
  - Users can select a view among a one-tailed test and two-tailed test. This shows how directional hypotheses can change the study results without changing sample size.
