## Project Topic
Monte Carlo Simulation of a Hypothesis Test of Binomially Distributed Samples [One-sample z-test for a binomial proportion]

## Simulation vs. Dataset
We will using pure simulation

## Project Detail

$$
X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p), \qquad
$$
We'll consider the following Hypothesis:
$$
H_0: p = p_0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a: p \neq p_0
$$
Hypothesis tests for binomial data are widely used in applications involving binary outcomes, such as quality control and clinical trials. Monte Carlo simulation allows practitioners to assess whether the normal approximation performs adequately for their specific sample size and parameter settings.
