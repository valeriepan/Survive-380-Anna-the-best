## Project Topic

Monte Carlo Simulation of a Hypothesis Test of Binomially Distributed Samples [One-sample z-test for a binomial proportion]

## Simulation vs. Dataset

We will using pure simulation

## Project Detail

$$
X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p), \qquad
$$ We'll consider the following Hypothesis: $$
H_0: p = p_0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a: p \neq p_0
$$

## User Input(Shiny Components)
### Core Simulation Controls
- **Simulation Sample Size**:
    - Users can set the number of Monte Carlo simulations (range: 1,000 to 10,000) via a dual slider or numeric input.
    - Demonstrates how increasing the sample size stabilizes Type I error and power estimates, reducing simulation-based variance.
- **Random Seed**:
    - An integer input field to initialize the pseudo-random number generator.
    - Ensures reproducibility in scientific research, allowing users to generate identical results for verification and ecological modeling.
- **Number of Trials ($n$)**:
    - A slider (range: 10–500) representing the sample size of individual units.
    - Affects the denominator of the z-score; illustrates how larger $n$ reduces standard error and improves test sensitivity.
- **Success Probability ($p$)**:
    - A slider (range: 0 to 1) for the true population proportion.
    - Allows users to explore how different effect sizes impact the statistical power of the test.

### Advanced Features
- **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**:
    - An adjustable threshold input for statistical significance.
    - Dynamically updates the rejection region on the plot and recalculates the estimated Type I error rate.
- **Hypothesis Test Directionality**:
    - A toggle switch between **one-sided** and **two-sided** tests.
    - Shows how directional hypotheses change results and p-values without altering the sample size or effect size.
- **Visualization Toggles**:
    - Buttons to switch between different plot types (e.g., Binomial PMF vs. simulated sampling distribution).
    - Provides multiple perspectives on the data, from theoretical distributions to empirical simulation results.
- **Color Themes**:
    - A selection menu with various color palettes (including palettes from @nichols2026).
    - Enhances accessibility for color-blind users and allows for clear visual distinction between plot elements.
